## üåü Highlights

- Gets up to date information from the Yahoo Finance API.
- Easy to download, set up, and use


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
This is a personal interest project made by me. I am interested in learning more about Golang, web services and APIs and I have a personal interest in finance so I created this app to combine those interests. The project is currently a work-in-progress but as of May 23, 2024 it provides a simple Go server and interactive command line interface. These services use GRPC to make calls between the CLI and the server, with a very simple setup of protobuf definitions defined in the proto folder.

## üöÄ Usage
The project relies on the Yahoo Finance API provided by https://financeapi.net/. To begin, get an api key from this url by creating an account. Set the environment variable 'STOCKS_API_KEY' to this key, and the environment variable 'STOCKS_URL' to localhost:9090 (for now). Then, run the server and the CLI using the commands below.

```bash
# Launches the server and detaches the process, alternatively, run it in its own shell
$ make server &
$ make stocks_cli
$ stocks_cli
                    STOCKS PROGRAM
Please enter 'get' followed by the stock ticker you would like to retrieve, or enter 'q' to quit
